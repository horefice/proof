# ProofAdoc

With ProofAdoc you can instantly create an immutable record of existence, integrity and ownership of a doc!

## How it Works?

Hashing -> Signing -> Publishing

### 1. Hashing

Hashing allows ProofAdoc to protect your data and certify its integrity.

### 2. Signing

Signing is done by asymmetrical cryptography, which is used to verify that the holder of the private key/secret sent the message.

### 3. Publishing

Publishing consists in publishing the doc's record (AuthCode), using trustable third-parties (e.g. a tweet, an email) or a distributed solution (e.g. blockchain) to timestamp the AuthCode.
